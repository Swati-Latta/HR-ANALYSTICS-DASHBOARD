- The attrition rate is relatively low on the job role Research Director, Manager, Healthcare Representative, Manufacturing Director, and Human Resources (ordered from highest to lowest Attrition Rate)
- 
- The majority of workers live two to five kilometers from the office. The high attrition rate seen in the chart is due to the large number of data; there is no significant association found between attrition rate and distance from home.
  
- It can be seen that 60% of the research population is male, against 40% females. Both groups have the same distribution in age, ranging from 18 - 60.
  
- The rate of attrition between male and female employees stays roughly the same at 15%.
  
- It is noticeable that the age range of 25 to 35 stands out with the most remarkable attrition rate, indicating a higher tendency of voluntary exits among all brackets. Conversely, from around 40 onwards, a downtrend was recorded, suggesting a reduced likelihood for departures. Similarly, a declining trend manifests itself starkly from the age of 25 downwards, which can most likely attributed to the probation period or introductory time span for the company.

- The attrition rate is specifically lower for the following positions: Research and Manufacturing Directors, Managers, HR and Healthcare representatives.

- It can be seen that the attrition rate is higher for employees who are paid lower, from $2000 to $4000.
